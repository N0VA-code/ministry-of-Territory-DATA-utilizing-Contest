## **AI-based Prediction System for Eco-Friendly Urban Planning**

### üí° Project Overview
Our project is an AI-based traffic and environmental prediction system that uses the ARIMA time series prediction model to learn past traffic volume data and predict future traffic volume, and calculates the expected fine dust emission from this.

### üöó Traffic Volume Prediction
Using the Python-based ARIMA model, we learn past traffic volume data over the past several years to accurately predict future traffic volume.

### üå´Ô∏è Fine Dust Emission Calculation
Using the mathematical relationship between traffic volume and fine dust emission, we calculate the expected fine dust emission from the predicted traffic volume.

### üìä Data Visualization and Platform Hosting
To make it easier for users to understand data, we visualize the predicted traffic volume and fine dust emission in graphs. The visualization platform implemented with next.js is hosted via Vercel.

### üåç Future Value
This system can help establish an efficient fine dust response plan and support eco-friendly urban planning. It can serve as a platform that enhances the value of land and transport data and contributes to the environmental protection efforts of our society.
